# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteers to help this project come to fruition.

## Evangelism

CTOHunt is primarily an effort to help startups and awesome CTOs discover each other. This is and will remain a non-profit effort licensed under GPL. So, please share the word!

## Moderation

As the site grows, there may occasionally be posts that violate our [code of conduct](/code_of_conduct.md). Please help by flagging such posts so we can take appropriate action as promptly as possible. If you would like to volunteer to maintain the site, let us know via the discussions!

## Submitting changes

To start with, we want to keep the workflow as simple as possible. Priorities are improvements to the issue templates and marketing automations using Github Actions.

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to ctohunt](https://github.com/ctohunt/ctohunt.com/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


Thanks,
Tej Pochiraju, CTOHunt.com
