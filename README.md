Like ProductHunt but for CTOs.

## TLDR

### Organisation seeking CTO

1. Create an issue with the [organisation template](https://github.com/ctohunt/ctohunt.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=organisation&template=organisation.md&title=%5BSeeking+CTO%5D+)
2. Monitor and respond to comments - by default you will be notified on your Github login email.
3. Take evaluation, and courtship, offline. 


### Technologist seeking CTO Role

1. Create an issue with the [technologist template](https://github.com/ctohunt/ctohunt.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=technologist&template=technologist.md&title=%5BSeeking+Org%5D+)
2. Monitor and respond to comments - by default you will be notified on your Github login email.
3. Take evaluation, and courtship, offline. 


## Why

There are startups started by technologists and then there others. Of these others, some have good technologists in their network and bring them in as CTOs. This here is an experiment to help the rest. 

There are essentially 3 stages to hiring a CTO:

1. Discovery
2. Evaluation
3. Courtship

This site/repo focuses on Step 1 - Discovery. 

### Why Is Discovery Hard?

- Discovery is a pretty complex two-sided marketplace problem. 
- Unlike Amazon, a larger marketplace is actually a worse, noisier marketplace.
- Cue, vertical marketplaces like YC's https://www.workatastartup.com/ or language specific ones like https://elixir-radar.com/jobs

## How does this site help?

1. Github is where most of the potential CTOs already are.
2. [**Issues**](https://github.com/ctohunt/ctohunt.com/issues) are a great fit for listing openings and profiles. They are mostly just text and the pre-built templates are accessible to non-technical folks too. 
  - The full text search works *really* well.
  - Open/Closed are obvious fits.
3. For feedback and everything else, [**Discussions**](https://github.com/ctohunt/ctohunt.com/discussions) are open on this repository.

## Great, how do I use this site?
